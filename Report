Abstract
This report evaluates the implementation of a shared memory and process synchronization solution in C. The program creates four 
child processes, which modify a shared variable while ensuring synchronization using POSIX shared memory and mutexes. The parent 
process ensures the results are printed in the correct order before the child processes exit. Performance testing showed stable 
execution times, minimal memory usage, and low CPU overhead.

1. Introduction
This project aims to create four child processes that increment a shared variable concurrently. Each process performs a set number
of increments and stores the result in shared memory. The parent process prints the results after all processes finish their work. 
To manage synchronization, the solution uses POSIX shared memory and mutex locks to avoid conflicts between processes accessing the 
shared variable.

2. System Setup
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
Operating System: macOS Sonoma 14.4.1 (23E224)
Test Environment: The code was tested on a virtual machine.
3. Implementation
The program uses fork() to create four child processes, which perform different amounts of increments (100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 
and 500,000). Shared memory (shmget(), shmat()) is used to store the results, and a pthread_mutex_t lock ensures that no two processes 
modify the shared variable at the same time. The parent process waits for all child processes to signal that they are done before 
printing the results.

4. Performance Evaluation
4.1 Execution Time
Execution time was measured using the time command. Below are the results for three test runs:

Run	User Time	System Time	Total Time

real	0m0.029s
user	0m0.054s
sys	0m0.000s

4.2 Memory Usage
The shared memory segment allocated 128 bytes, which was enough to store the results and status flags for the processes. The program
efficiently handled memory, as the total allocation was very small.

4.3 CPU Usage
CPU usage was minimal since the tasks were relatively simple. The majority of time was spent in user mode, with very little overhead 
in the system.

5. Analysis
The program met all requirements and performed well. Each child process incremented its counters correctly, and the parent ensured 
the results were printed in the correct order before the processes exited. The use of POSIX shared memory and mutex locks successfully
avoided race conditions.

The programâ€™s execution time and memory usage were both low, as expected for a task of this complexity. The solution could scale up to
handle more processes with minor adjustments to the shared memory structure.

6. Conclusion
This project demonstrated the successful use of shared memory and process synchronization in C. The program ran efficiently, with low 
execution time and minimal memory usage. It met all the required specifications, and the implementation could be extended for more 
complex tasks with additional processes.
